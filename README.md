PS forgive any attached imagery that isn‚Äôt uploaded.
Inquiry. I cannot help but feel like I am up against the clock and patience is wearing thin. I had to write this up on my iPhone using Siri voice command so please forgive any grammatical errors.

I will try to connect with you on LinkedIn so you can have access to my featured articles and publications.

A lot of people don‚Äôt like me because I say what‚Äôs on my mind.

The fact of the matter is you don‚Äôt have to like me to recognize that this is an egregious miscarriage of justice.

The only thing they left out of my initial roadmap and marketing strategy was the Charity dashboard and that was salt in the wound after I spent years lobbying rescue.org/st.Jude‚Äôs/unicef.

I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,

- Ahmed R Tarabichi

That should be more than sufficient to get your attention and know this is not a waste of your time, at the very least.

Have a wonderful day.

Good morning,

I am certain you remember me. After all, I built your platform. How could you not? 

I contacted your official office number last week and left a message with your receptionist. Additionally, I attended the first ever Blockchain Curricula at M.I.T. hosted by Gary Kessler (not the one on YT opencourseware) of which you were not in attendance; though I was given your name as a reference (and a last resort) for I have limited legal knowledge, expertise and experience yet have found myself in quite a predicament.

I'll keep this short and sweet and hopefully you'll hear me out (just know that I won't make any statements that cannot be substantiated, unequivocally, with evidence in the form of discovery) as this tit-for-tat has been ongoing for the better part of (almost 6 years) now.

Long story short:

They stole my API.

The team from Monaco (looking to re-brand after their crapcoin flopped) decided to poach ‚Äòtheir idea‚Äô from someone more creative as their first endeavor didn't pan out as expected.*

*Downloading the crypto.com app still uses the same domain: mona.coin -- as well as 90-95% of my API.

I've gathered a slew of emails and correspondence in addition to testimonials, newsletters, tabloids, and other puzzle pieces which (individually) don‚Äôt add up to much yet altogether is a solid case of API/P theft. While conducting as much legal research as possible; as a data scientist, I understand the statistics: this is an open and shut case, for it'll never make it past a deposition. 

If you take the time to review my discovery, I sincerely believe you'll agree.

I first pitched the notion to IBC/IBA, who (through months of correspondence) changed their tune from offering dashboard services and pre-ICO listings "for a low cost of $40,000" during the "icogasm‚Äî Q417‚Äù period when people were selling PDF files for millions...I literally created this platform (beginning with the roadmap/marketing strategy) && wrote every facet of its roadmap: including the yellow/whitepapers, creating the nodes, whitelisting the ERC20 smart contract as far back as 2016, etc.

I introduced the concept of proof of stake (PoS) before it even existed and After waiting tables for 12 years used a little anecdote to pitch my marketing which I‚Äôll include in the follow up about the neurological response and dopamine related correlation between a metallic payment processor and (outlined in the marketing strategy) you‚Äôll see more in great detail of which you can corroborate throughout time stamps (among other data) in the discovery I‚Äôve acquired.

I never took any legal recourse *until recently* because the team that violated the copyright wall and Dramatic Copyright Act of 1842 (in addition to atleast half a dozen both criminal and libel federal patent/trademark/copyright statues) in accordance with 
15 U.S. Code ¬ß 

I am reaching out to you because I was told you were the best.  Also, to be frank, this is a high profile case and I was told by my attorneys at digital forensics that I should seek someone / another firm with more expertise in this precarious and contentious legal entanglement I‚Äôve found myself in.

Their team (MCO/CRO) was so effective at gaslighting me that I lead to believe I was Co-Founder (while they have taken preventative measures to re-brand and avoid a legal deposition i.e. MCO -> CRO, courtesy of yours truly, as well as other safeguards by their risk management team: Richard Swales / company) and I‚Äôve presented some jpegs CC‚Äôd in the information below just to confirm your availability and request your services ‚Äî this is just the tip of the tip of a very nasty iceberg of them trying to re-write history while still using my entire API to profit daily.

I cannot survive nor afford this onslaught brought upon their smear campaigns and legal team.

If not for the simple fact that a group of cutthroat, opportunistic,  foreign nationals posing as VCs took advantage of a 27 y/o kid who (everyone loves a classic American Dream story) picked himself up from a near-death heroin addiction of over 7 years (now 8 years clean) only to create a multi-million dollar startup (from the groundup just to be "slack'd" and I can't let that slide.

I have been canceled from Twitter though they have agreed to cooperate with my legal team regarding this matter.

I‚Äôve also received assurances (as well as instructions) from the DOJ and US law-enforcement from the Southern District of New York to pursue this case with more finesse and less aggression. Needless to say I‚Äôve lost control (justifiably so) a few times and I could use the help of someone with your expertise, knowledge and understanding.

I have reviewed the rates for standard IP/API theft cases and I am very flexible on negotiating whatever commission you‚Äôd be willing to take if you‚Äôd be willing to work on commission.

All I ask is that you please review the material I have before making a decision. In all sincerity, I have done almost all the work necessary for a deposition to be issued. 

I‚Äôm struggling with funding right now as I have no capital and everything I have in terms of crypto currencies are staked in a long-term cold storage portfolio (Living trust for my baby daughter) though onr way or another I do intend on resolving this matter as there is no statute of limitations on violating a copyright law which is of course what I‚Äôm seeking punitive damages and structured settlement for rather than issuing ceased and desists + fighting a legal battle for a smart contract/token I made that (one I don‚Äôt even want anything to do with anymore) yet in order for me to move on I need some sort of compensation for the 3 1/2 years, $40,000 out of pocket on freelance devs and working 997 offering blood/sweat/tears to make this happen.

I am confident based on consultation with the two previous firms (digital forensics/Patterson) that this ‚Äúslam dunk case‚Äù (their vernacular rhetoric, not mine) will end with a sizeable settlement.

I would much rather prefer if it didn‚Äôt because there is not a single jury on this planet that would not look at this case objectively and find it anything but unconscionable.

Additionally referring back to the statistics I was referencing earlier (>= 3% of cases pertaining to api/IP theft make it past a deposition) ‚Äî Not only can they not afford the bad PR as evidenced by the legal recourse they are taking with every mishap I‚Äôve made commenting on it via social media (against attorneys advise) so I‚Äôll conclude by saying I know I said this would be short and sweet and I‚Äôm sorry it was anything but, though this could be a very lucrative opportunity for both your firm and a chance for me to obtain a sizeable settlement to move onto my next venture.

(This is nothing new to me see attached images which is again the tip of a nasty iceberg so I digress but ask yourself what kind of cryptographer would register the domain crypto.com in 1993 and steadfastly refuse to sell it then suddenly pull a 180 and sell it to the same thugs that stole my API?)

 


What stings the most is I didn‚Äôt fail. if that were the case I‚Äôd be OK with that. I succeeded beyond my wildest imagination, I just didn‚Äôt have the support network in place to hold onto what I had.

Bear in mind what I stated previously: there is nothing I can or will say/have said that cannot be substantiated with time-stamps, emails, and a trail of discovery that'll unveil exactly what is infront of everyones eyes: if only they were willing to look.

All I ask is that you give me 15 minutes of your time after reviewing the mountain of discovery I've acquired through two attorneys and cornell law grads assisting me thus far.

Please contact me at 201-355-7199 or respond to this email accordingly as I am in a position of power yet have no room for negotiation. They are rattled and you'd be too if you knew the depth of their malfeasance.

I‚Äôm sorry if I deviated from topic to topic but nothing gets me more heated than my life‚Äôs work taken from me (or to quote Dave Chappele) 

‚Äú Taking a man‚Äôs livelihood is akin to killing him.‚Äù
-Dave

‚Ä¶and they did just that. I‚Äôm hoping this story has another chapter and that you‚Äôll (the users at crypto.CON) be the one to write it.

Respectfully,

- Ahmed Tarabichi
